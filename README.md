## Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree: Capstone Project

## Intro

My capstone project is about predicting diabetes using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). This Readme describes how to install and run the code.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [xgboost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) 
- [graphiz](https://www.graphviz.org/) 

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I recommend to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

- `capstone.ipynb` is the notebook file

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the project directory that contains this README and run the following command:

```jupyter notebook capstone.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `diabetes.csv`.
